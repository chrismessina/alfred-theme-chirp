# Chirp Powerpack Theme Collection for Alfred

This is a collection of 18 [Alfred Powerpack Themes](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/appearance/) inspired by Twitter's [custom typeface Chirp](https://twitter.com/DerritDeRouen/status/1354548649561186306) and its [customizable view options](https://twitter.com/i/display):

## Installation

This theme uses the Chirp font, which is not available for public distribution. If you happen to obtain it, use the themes in the "Chirp" folder.

Alternatively, since Chirp is just a custom version of Grilli Type's [GT America](https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-america), you can [download a free trial](https://www.grillitype.com/free-trial-fonts) and use that. Once you've installed **GT America Trial Lt** and **GT America Trial Bd**, you can install the themes in the "GT America" folder. Note that the trial version of GT America doesnâ€™t contain kerning, accents, alternate characters or other OpenType features.

You can either double-click an `.alfredappearance` file to install it or use [@vitor](https://github.com/vitorgalvao)'s [Batch Theme Importer Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vitorgalvao/requested-alfred-workflows/master/Workflows/Batch%20Import%20Themes.alfredworkflow) to import them all at once.
